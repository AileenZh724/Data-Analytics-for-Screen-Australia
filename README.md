# Data-Analytics-for-Screen-Australia

This repo is for use with the subject QBUS6600 Data Analytics for Business Capstone taught at the University of Sydney.

This repo aims to use exploratory data analysis discover the factors influence film revenues and the trend of movies screened in Australia over time. 
The dataset collected from Numero on a weekly basis and from Opus Data is Australian box office data for movies from January 2020 to January 2022. 

The report initially found some patterns between variables and box office revenue. For those actors who presents high number of films, the films they performed having comparably higher box office revenues. 
But the amount of data was too small to provide accurate results. Also, the data may be affected during the pandemic. 
We find that some variables contain multi-collinearity which may cause negative impact on future study.
